On March 25, simultaneous bicoastal raids of his Los Angeles and Miami homes played out live on CNN while the hip-hop mogul was on his private jet amid what could turn out to be a very public reckoning. Then, on September 16, the indictment against Diddy was revealed, and he was charged on three counts, including sex trafficking by force. He pleaded not guilty before he was denied bail. He is currently being held in jail awaiting a trial. In addition to an investigation from Homeland Security and the federal government, he is also facing four federal lawsuits. A fifth, brought in late 2023 by his ex-girlfriend Cassandra “Cassie” Ventura, which included allegations of rape and physical abuse, was settled and dismissed days after it had been filed.In civil court, however, he faces a deluge of sexual'),\n",

Upon information and belief, Mr. Combs laced the liquor with ecstasy,” the lawsuit claims. He also accuses Combs of sexual harassment and assault for allegedly grabbing him without his consent and forcing him to work while Combs paraded around naked. Jones also alleges that Combs once left him alone in a makeshift studio on a yacht with Cuba Gooding Jr., who he said then began “touching, groping, and fondling” his upper thighs near his groin.
